# ReAct Agent

A configurable ReAct agent. This agent leverages the AIQ toolkit plugin system and `WorkflowBuilder` to integrate pre-built and custom tools into the workflow. Key elements are summarized below:

## Key Features

- **Pre-built Tools:** Leverages core AIQ toolkit library agent and tools.
- **ReAct agent:** Performs reasoning between tool call; utilizes tool names and descriptions to appropriately route to the correct tool
- **Custom Plugin System:** Developers can bring in new tools using plugins.
- **High-level API:** Enables defining functions that transform into asynchronous LangChain tools.
- **Agentic Workflows:** Fully configurable via YAML for flexibility and productivity.
- **Ease of Use:** Simplifies developer experience and deployment.

## Installation and Setup

If you have not already done so, follow the instructions in the [Install Guide](../../../docs/source/quick-start/installing.md#install-from-source) to create the development environment and install AIQ toolkit.

### Install this Workflow:

From the root directory of the AIQ toolkit library, run the following commands:

```bash
uv pip install -e .
```

The `code_generation` and `wiki_search` tools are part of the `aiqtoolkit[langchain]` package.  To install the package run the following command:
```bash
# local package install from source
uv pip install -e '.[langchain]'
```

### Set Up API Keys
If you have not already done so, follow the [Obtaining API Keys](../../../docs/source/quick-start/installing.md#obtaining-api-keys) instructions to obtain an NVIDIA API key. You need to set your NVIDIA API key as an environment variable to access NVIDIA AI services:

```bash
export NVIDIA_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```
---

## Run the Workflow

The ReAct agent can be used as either a workflow or a function, and there's an example configuration that demonstrates both.
If you’re looking for an example workflow where the ReAct agent runs as the main workflow, refer to [config.yml](configs/config.yml).
To see the ReAct agent used as a function within a workflow, alongside the Reasoning Agent, refer to [config-reasoning.yml](configs/config-reasoning.yml).
This README primarily covers the former case, where the ReAct agent functions as the main workflow, in config.yml.
For more details, refer to the [ReAct agent documentation](../../../docs/source/workflows/about/react-agent.md) and the [Reasoning agent documentation](../../../docs/source/workflows/about/reasoning-agent.md)

Run the following command from the root of the AIQ toolkit repo to execute this workflow with the specified input:

```bash
aiq run  --config_file=examples/agents/react/configs/config.yml --input "who was Djikstra?"
```

**Expected Output**

```console
$ aiq run  --config_file=examples/agents/react/configs/config.yml --input "who was Djikstra?"

Edsger Wybe Dijkstra ( DYKE-strə; Dutch: [ˈɛtsxər ˈʋibə ˈdɛikstraː] ; 11 May 1930 – 6 August 2002) was a Dutch computer scientist, programmer, software engineer, mathematician, and science essayist.
Born in Rotterdam in the Netherlands, Dijkstra studied mathematics and physics and then theoretical physics at the University of Leiden. Adriaan van Wijngaarden offered him a job as the first computer programmer in the Netherlands at the Mathematical Centre in Amsterdam, where he worked from 1952 until 1962. He formulated and solved the shortest path problem in 1956, and in 1960 developed the first compiler for the programming language ALGOL 60 in conjunction with colleague Jaap A. Zonneveld. In 1962 he moved to Eindhoven, and later to Nuenen, where he became a professor in the Mathematics Department at the Technische Hogeschool Eindhoven. In the late 1960s he built the THE multiprogramming system, which influence...
