# Mixture of Agents Example

An example of a Mixture of Agents (naive Mixture of Experts / naive Agent Hypervisor). This agent leverages the AIQ toolkit plugin system and `WorkflowBuilder` to integrate pre-built and custom tools into the workflows, and workflows as tools. Key elements are summarized below:

## Key Features

- **Pre-built Tools and Agents:** Leverages core AIQ toolkit library agents and tools.
- **ReAct Agent:** Performs reasoning between agent / tool call; utilizes agent / tool names and descriptions to appropriately route to the correct agent or tool.
- **Tool Calling Agent** The "Expert Agents" are Tool Calling Agents.  They leverages tool / function input schema to appropriately route to the correct tool.
- **Custom Plugin System:** Developers can bring in new agents and tools using plugins.
- **High-level API:** Enables defining functions that transform agents and tools into asynchronous LangChain tools.
- **Agentic Workflows:** Fully configurable via YAML for flexibility and productivity. Customize agents, agent's tools, prompts, and more.
- **Ease of Use:** Simplifies developer experience and deployment.

## Installation and Setup

If you have not already done so, follow the instructions in the [Install Guide](../../../docs/source/quick-start/installing.md#install-from-source) to create the development environment and install AIQ toolkit.

### Install this Workflow:

From the root directory of the AIQ toolkit repository, run the following commands:

```bash
uv pip install -e .
```

The `code_generation` and `wiki_search` tools are part of the `aiqtoolkit[langchain]` package.  To install the package run the following command:
```bash
# local package install from source
uv pip install -e '.[langchain]'
```

In addition to this the example utilizes some tools from the `examples/simple_calculator` example.  To install the package run the following command:
```bash
uv pip install -e examples/simple_calculator
```

### Set Up API Keys
If you have not already done so, follow the [Obtaining API Keys](../../../docs/source/quick-start/installing.md#obtaining-api-keys) instructions to obtain an NVIDIA API key. You need to set your NVIDIA API key as an environment variable to access NVIDIA AI services:
```bash
export NVIDIA_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```

### Run the Workflow

Run the following command from the root of the AIQ toolkit repo to execute this workflow with the specified input:

```bash
aiq run --config_file=examples/agents/mixture_of_agents/configs/config.yml --input "who was Djikstra?"
```

**Expected Output**

```console
$ aiq run --config_file=examples/agents/mixture_of_agents/configs/config.yml --input "who was Djikstra?"
