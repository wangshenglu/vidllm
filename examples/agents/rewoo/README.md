# ReWOO Agent Example

This example demonstrates how to use A configurable [ReWOO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18323) (Reasoning WithOut Observation) Agent with the AIQ toolkit. For this purpose AIQ toolkit provides a [`rewoo_agent`](../../../docs/source/workflows/about/rewoo-agent.md) workflow type.

## Installation and Setup

If you have not already done so, follow the instructions in the [Install Guide](../../../docs/source/quick-start/installing.md#install-from-source) to create the development environment and install AIQ toolkit.

### Install this Workflow:

From the root directory of the AIQ toolkit library, run the following commands:

```bash
uv sync --all-groups --all-extras
uv pip install -e .
```

### Set Up API Keys
If you have not already done so, follow the [Obtaining API Keys](../../../docs/source/quick-start/installing.md#obtaining-api-keys) instructions to obtain an NVIDIA API key. You need to set your NVIDIA API key as an environment variable to access NVIDIA AI services:

```bash
export NVIDIA_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```

Prior to using the `tavily_internet_search` tool, create an account at [`tavily.com``](https://tavily.com/) and obtain an API key. Once obtained, set the `TAVILY_API_KEY` environment variable to the API key:
```bash
export TAVILY_API_KEY=<YOUR_TAVILY_API_KEY>
```
---

Run the following command from the root of the AIQ toolkit repo to execute this workflow with the specified input:

```bash
aiq run  --config_file=examples/agents/rewoo/configs/config.yml --input "Which city held the Olympic game in the year represented by the bigger number of 1996 and 2004?"
```

**Expected Output**

```console
$ aiq run  --config_file=examples/agents/rewoo/configs/config.yml --input "Which city held the Olympic game in the year represented by the bigger number of 1996 and 2004?"
