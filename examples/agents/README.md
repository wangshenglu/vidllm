# Agent Examples

The agent examples demonstrate how AIQ toolkit accelerates and enables AI Agent development.
The examples showcase 5 distinct AI Agent architectures solving a similar problem in different ways. By leveraging the AIQ toolkit plugin system and the `Builder` object, you can use both pre-built and custom agentic workflows and tools in a flexible manner.
