# MCP Server Example

This example demonstrates how to set up and run an MCP (Model Control Protocol) server using a reusable `Dockerfile`.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Available MCP Services

This example uses the `mcp-server-time` service. For a list of available public MCP services, please refer to the [MCP Server GitHub repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers).

## Setup

1. Change the service name and brief name to the service you want to use.

```bash
# This should be the name of the MCP service you want to use.
export SERVICE_NAME=mcp-server-time
# This can be any name you want to give to your service.
export SERVICE_BRIEF_NAME=time
```

2. Set the service directory, server port, and container name.

```bash
export SERVICE_DIR=./.tmp/mcp/${SERVICE_BRIEF_NAME}_service
export CONTAINER_NAME=mcp-proxy-aiq-${SERVICE_BRIEF_NAME}
export SERVER_PORT=8080
```

3. Create a directory for your service and copy the `Dockerfile` to it:

```bash
mkdir -p ${SERVICE_DIR}
cp examples/simple_calculator/deploy_external_mcp/Dockerfile ${SERVICE_DIR}/
```

4. Create the run script:

```bash
cat > ${SERVICE_DIR}/run_service.sh <<EOF
#!/bin/bash
uvx run ${SERVICE_NAME}
EOF

chmod +x ${SERVICE_DIR}/run_service.sh
```

5. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```bash
cat > ${SERVICE_DIR}/docker-compose.yml <<EOF
services:
  ${SERVICE_BRIEF_NAME}_server:
    container_name: ${CONTAINER_NAME}
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "${SERVER_PORT}:${SERVER_PORT}"
    volumes:
      - ./run_service.sh:/scripts/run_service.sh
    command:
      - "--sse-port=${SERVER_PORT}"
      - "--sse-host=0.0.0.0"
      - "/scripts/run_service.sh"
EOF
```

6. Build and run the MCP server:

```bash
docker compose -f ${SERVICE_DIR}/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

7. Verify the MCP server is running and monitor the service:

```bash
docker ps
docker logs -f ${CONTAINER_NAME}
```

## Usage

The MCP server will be available at `http://localhost:${SERVER_PORT}/sse`. You can use it with any MCP-compatible client.

## Client Configuration

To use the MCP service in your AIQ toolkit application, configure the MCP tool wrapper in your config file:

```yaml
functions:
  ${SERVICE_BRIEF_NAME}_tool:
    _type: mcp_tool_wrapper
    url: "http://0.0.0.0:${SERVER_PORT}/sse"
    mcp_tool_name: get_current_time
    description: "Returns the current date and time from the MCP server"
```

Replace `get_current_time` with the actual tool name exposed by your service.
