# A Simple LangSmith-Documentation Agent

A minimal example demonstrating a simple LangSmith-Documentation agent. This agent leverages the AIQ toolkit plugin system and `Builder` to integrate pre-built and custom tools into the workflow to answer questions about LangSmith. Key elements are summarized below:

## Table of Contents

* [Key Features](#key-features)
* [Installation and Usage](#installation-and-setup)
* [Deployment-Oriented Setup](#docker-quickstart)

---

## Key Features

- **Pre-built Tools:** Leverages core AIQ toolkit library tools.
- **Custom Plugin System:** Developers can bring in new tools using plugins.
- **High-level API:** Enables defining functions that transform into asynchronous LangChain tools.
- **Agentic Workflows:** Fully configurable via YAML for flexibility and productivity.
- **Ease of Use:** Simplifies developer experience and deployment.

---

## Installation and Setup

If you have not already done so, follow the instructions in the [Install Guide](../../docs/source/quick-start/installing.md#install-from-source) to create the development environment and install AIQ toolkit.

### Install this Workflow:

From the root directory of the AIQ toolkit library, run the following commands:

```bash
uv pip install -e examples/simple
```

### Set Up API Keys
If you have not already done so, follow the [Obtaining API Keys](../../docs/source/quick-start/installing.md#obtaining-api-keys) instructions to obtain an NVIDIA API key. You need to set your NVIDIA API key as an environment variable to access NVIDIA AI services:

```bash
export NVIDIA_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```

### Run the Workflow

Run the following command from the root of the AIQ toolkit repo to execute this workflow with the specified input:

```bash
aiq run --config_file examples/simple/configs/config.yml --input "What is LangSmith?"
```

**Expected Output**

```console
$ aiq run --config_file examples/simple/configs/config.yml --input "What is LangSmith?"

## Docker Quickstart

Prior to building the Docker image ensure that you have followed the steps in the [Installation and Setup](#installation-and-setup) section, and you are currently in the AIQ toolkit virtual environment.

Set your NVIDIA API Key in the `NVIDIA_API_KEY` environment variable.

```bash
export NVIDIA_API_KEY="your_nvidia_api_key"
```

From the git repository root, run the following command to build AIQ toolkit and the simple agent into a Docker image.

```bash
docker build --build-arg AIQ_VERSION=$(python -m setuptools_scm) -f examples/simple/Dockerfile -t simple-agent .
```

Then, run the following command to run the simple agent.

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 -e NVIDIA_API_KEY simple-agent
```

After the container starts, you can access the agent at http://localhost:8000.

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8000/generate' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"input_message": "What is LangSmith?"}'
```
