---

## Installation and Setup

If you have not already done so, follow the instructions in the [Install Guide](../../docs/source/quick-start/installing.md#install-from-source) to create the development environment and install AIQ toolkit.

### Install this Workflow:

From the root directory of the AIQ toolkit library, run the following commands:

```bash
uv pip install -e examples/simple_calculator
```

### Set Up API Keys
If you have not already done so, follow the [Obtaining API Keys](../../docs/source/quick-start/installing.md#obtaining-api-keys) instructions to obtain an NVIDIA API key. You need to set your NVIDIA API key as an environment variable to access NVIDIA AI services:

```bash
export NVIDIA_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```

## Example Usage

This example makes use of [Arize Phoenix](https://docs.arize.com/phoenix) to visualize the traces generated by the workflow.

### Run Phoenix

Open a new terminal, source the virtual environment and run `phoenix serve` to capture traces.

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
phoenix serve
```

### Run the Workflow

Return to your original terminal, and run the following command from the root of the AIQ toolkit repo to execute this workflow with the specified input:

```bash
aiq run --config_file examples/simple_calculator/configs/config-tracing.yml --input "Is the product of 2 * 4 greater than the current hour of the day?"
```

**Expected Output**
The workflow output can be quite lengthy, the end of the workflow output should contain something similar to the following (the final answer will depend on the time of day the workflow is run):
```console
$ aiq run --config_file examples/simple_calculator/configs/config.yml --input "Is the product of 2 * 4 greater than the current hour of the day?"

### Examine the Traces in Phoenix
Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:6006` to view the traces.

## Using Weave for Tracing
You can use Weave to trace the workflow by following the instructions in the [Fine-grained Tracing with Weave](../../docs/source/workflows/observe/observe-workflow-with-weave.md) guide.
Sample usage:
```bash
aiq run --config_file examples/simple_calculator/configs/config-weave.yml --input "Is the product of 2 * 4 greater than the current hour of the day?"
```

## Accuracy Evaluation
The answers generated by the workflow can be evaluated using the [Tunable RAG Evaluator](../../docs/source/reference/evaluate.md#tunable-rag-evaluator). A sample dataset is provided in `examples/simple_calculator/data/simple_calculator.json`.

To run the evaluation, use the `aiq eval` command:

```bash
aiq eval --config_file examples/simple_calculator/configs/config-tunable-rag-eval.yml
```

The evaluation results will be saved in `examples/simple_calculator/.tmp/eval/simple_calculator/tuneable_eval_output.json`.


## MCP (Model Context Protocol)
### AIQ Toolkit as an MCP Client
You can run the simple calculator workflow using Remote MCP tools. In this case, the workflow acts as a MCP client and connects to the MCP server running on the specified URL. Details are provided in the [MCP Client Guide](../../docs/source/workflows/mcp/mcp-client.md).

### AIQ Toolkit as an MCP Server
You can publish the simple calculator tools via MCP using the `aiq mcp` command. Details are provided in the [MCP Server Guide](../../docs/source/workflows/mcp/mcp-server.md).

## Deployment-Oriented Setup

For a production deployment, use Docker:

### Build the Docker Image

Prior to building the Docker image ensure that you have followed the steps in the [Installation and Setup](#installation-and-setup) section, and you are currently in the AIQ toolkit virtual environment.

From the root directory of the Simple Calculator repository, build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build --build-arg AIQ_VERSION=$(python -m setuptools_scm) -t simple_calculator -f examples/simple_calculator/Dockerfile .
```

### Run the Docker Container
Deploy the container:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 -p 6006:6006 -e NVIDIA_API_KEY simple_calculator
```

Note, a phoenix telemetry service will be exposed at port 6006.

### Test the API
Use the following curl command to test the deployed API:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8000/generate' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"input_message": "Is the product of 2 * 4 greater than the current hour of the day?"}'
  ```

### Expected API Output
The API response should be similar to the following:

```bash
{
  "input": "Is the product of 2 * 4 greater than the current hour of the day?",
  "output": "No, the product of 2 * 4 (which is 8) is less than the current hour of the day (which is 16)."
}
```
## Accessing Request Metadata
Users can define custom routes that are dynamically added to the API server, and capture HTTP request metadata such
as the method, URL path, URL scheme, headers, query parameters, path parameters, host, port, and cookies.

### Add custom route
Associate your endpoint with a function by updating the `front_end` section  in the configuration file.
A full configuration file example is available at `examples/simple_calculator/configs/config-metadata.yml.`
```yaml
general:
  use_uvloop: true
  front_end:
    _type: fastapi
    endpoints:
      - path: /get_request_metadata
        method: POST
        description: Gets the request attributes from the request.
        function_name: current_request_attributes
  ```

### Access the request metadata
Get the instance of the `aiq.builder.context.AIQContext` object using the `aiq.builder.context.AIQContext.get()` method. This will give you access to the metadata method which holds the request attributes defined by the user on request. A complete example of the function can be found in `src/aiq/tool/server_tools.py.`
```python
@register_function(config_type=RequestAttributesTool)
async def current_request_attributes(config: RequestAttributesTool, builder: Builder):

    from starlette.datastructures import Headers
    from starlette.datastructures import QueryParams

    async def _get_request_attributes(unused: str) -> str:

        from aiq.builder.context import AIQContext
        aiq_context = AIQContext.get()
        method: str | None = aiq_context.metadata.method
        url_path: str | None = aiq_context.metadata.url_path
        url_scheme: str | None = aiq_context.metadata.url_scheme
        headers: Headers | None = aiq_context.metadata.headers
        query_params: QueryParams | None = aiq_context.metadata.query_params
        path_params: dict[str, str] | None = aiq_context.metadata.path_params
        client_host: str | None = aiq_context.metadata.client_host
        client_port: int | None = aiq_context.metadata.client_port
        cookies: dict[str, str] | None = aiq_context.metadata.cookies

    yield FunctionInfo.from_fn(_get_request_attributes,
                               description="Returns the acquired user defined request attriubutes.")
```
